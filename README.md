# Explanation of Each Implementation

As shown, the text-based input is encoded to DNA, which is then converted to binary, converted to DNA once again through an `XNOR` function with a key, converted to mRNA, DNA, and the result is split and rotated. This process (shaded in blue in the figure above) is referred to as a 'round function'. The authors recommend using at least 10 round functions. In the final step, the in-progress ciphertext undergoes a final encoding.
